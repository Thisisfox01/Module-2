# Smart Contract 

the project aims to provide a user interface for interacting with the smart contract,
allowing users to view their balance, transaction history, interest rate, loan amount, 
and make loan payments. The component utilizes the ethers library for Ethereum interactions 
and the ATM contract ABI for communication with the smart contract.

## Description

The project at hand involves the development of a web application that interfaces with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The React component within the application manages various states related to the user's Ethereum wallet, account information, 
ATM contract instance, balance, transaction history, interest rate, loan amount, and loan payment status. By utilizing 
the Ethereum blockchain, users can interact with the smart contract to perform actions such as viewing their balance, 
accessing transaction history, checking interest rates, specifying loan amounts, and making loan payments. The smart contract, 
identified by the contract address and ABI provided in the code snippet, governs the logic and functionality of these operations. 
Through the integration of the ethers library for Ethereum interactions and the ATM contract ABI for communication with the smart contract, 
the project aims to provide a seamless and secure platform for users to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications 
and manage their financial activities on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Open the Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.
2. Create a new file and paste the provided code snippet into the editor.
3. Make sure to import the necessary dependencies such as React, ethers, and the ATM contract ABI.
4. Ensure that you have the correct contract address and ABI for the smart contract you want to interact with.


### Executing program

• Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and then click on "Compile" to compile the smart contract.
• Deploy the smart contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and selecting the contract you want to deploy.
• Interact with the deployed smart contract using the functions and states defined in your React component.
